    "section": "Why switch away from BibTeX and BibDesk?",
    "text": "Why switch away from BibTeX and BibDesk?\nBibDesk got me through my dissertation and all my research projects up until now, so why consider switching away to some other system? Over the past few years, as I’ve done more reading on my iPad and worked on more coauthored projects, I’ve run into a few pain points in my citation workflow.\n\nProblem 1: Cross-device reading\nI enjoy reading PDFs on my iPad (particularly in the iAnnotate app), but getting PDFs from BibDesk onto the iPad has always required a bizarre dance:\n\nStore references.bib and the BibDesk-managed folder of PDFs in Dropbox\nUse the References iPad app to open the BibTeX file from Dropbox on the iPad\nUse iAnnotate to navigate Dropbox and find the PDF I want to read\nRead and annotate the PDF in iAnnotate\nSend the finished PDF from iAnnotate back to Dropbox and go back to References to ensure that the annotated PDF updates\n\nI’d often get sick of this convoluted process and just find the PDF on my computer and AirDrop it to my iPad directly, completely circumventing Dropbox. I’d then AirDrop it back to my computer and attach the marked up PDF to the reference in BibDesk. It’s inconvenient, but less inconvenient than bouncing around a bunch of different apps and hoping everything works.\n\n\nProblem 2: Collaboration across many projects with many coauthors\nCollaboration with a single huge references.bib file is impossible. I could share my Dropbox folder with coauthors, but then they’d see all my entries and have access to all my annotated PDFs, which seems like overkill. As I started working with coauthors, I decided to make smaller project-specific .bib files that would be shareable and editable.\nThis is great for project modularity—see how this bibliography.bib file only contains things we cited? But it caused major synchronization problems. If me or a coauthor makes any edits to the project-specific files (adding a DOI to an existing entry, adding a new entry, etc.), those changes don’t show up in my big master references.bib file. I have to remember to copy those changes to the main file, and I never remember. With some recent projects, I’ve actually been copying some entries from previous projects’ .bib files rather than from the big references.bib file. Everything’s diverging and it’s a pain.\n\n\nProblem 3: BibTeX was designed for LaTeX—but just LaTeX\nBibTeX works great with LaTeX. That’s why it was invented in the first place! The fact that things like pandoc work with it is partially a historical accident—.bib files were a convenient and widely used plain text bibliography format, so pandoc and MultiMarkdown used BibTeX for citations.\nBut citations are often more complicated than BibTeX can handle. Consider the LaTeX package biblatex-chicago—in order to be fully compliant with all the intricacies of the Chicago Manual of Style, it has to expand the BibTeX (technically BibLaTeX) format to include fields like entrysubtype for distinguishing between magazine/newspaper articles and journal articles, among dozens of other customizations and tweaks. BibTeX has a limited set of entry types, and anything that’s not one of those types gets shoehorned into the misc type.\nInternally, programs like pandoc that can read BibTeX files convert them into a standard Citation Style Language (CSL) format, which it then uses to format references as Chicago, APA, MLA, or whatever. It would be great to store all my citations in a CSL-compliant format in the first place rather than as a LaTeX-only format that has to be constantly converted on-the-fly when converting to any non-LaTeX output.\n\n\nThe solution: Zotero\nZotero conveniently fixes all these issues:\n\nIt has a synchronization service that works across platforms (including iOS). It can work with Dropbox too if you don’t want to be bound by their file size limit or pay for extra storage, though I ended up paying for storage to (1) support open source software and (2) not have to deal with multiple programs. I’ve been doing the BibDesk → iAnnotate → Dropbox → MacBook → AirDrop dance for too many years—I just want Zotero to handle all the syncing for me.\nIt’s super easy to collaborate with Zotero. You can create shared group libraries with different sets of coauthors and not worry about Dropbox synchronization issues or accidental deletion of } characters in the .bib file. For one of my reading-intensive class, I’ve even created a shared Zotero group library that all the students can join and cite from, which is neat.\nIt’s also far easier to maintain a master list of references. You can create a Zotero collection for specific projects, and items can live in multiple collections. Editing an item in one collection updates that item in all other collections. Zotero treats collections like iTunes/Apple Music playlists—just like songs can belong to multiple playlists, bibliographic entries can belong to multiple collections.\nZotero follows the CSL standard that pandoc uses. It was the first program to adopt CSL (way back in 2006!). It supports all kinds of entry types and fields, beyond what BibTeX supports."

    "text": "Preparing for the migration\nMigrating my big .references.bib file to Zotero was a relatively straightforward process, but it required a few minor shenanigans to get everything working right.\n\nMake a backup\nPreparing everything for migration meant I had to make a ton of edits to the original references.bib file, so I made a copy of it first and worked with the copy.\n\n\nInstall extensions\nTo make Zotero work nicely with a pandoc-centric writing workflow, and to make file management and tag management easier, I installed these three extensions:\n\nBetter BibTeX\nZotFile\nZotero Tag\n\n\n\nRatings and read status\nBibDesk allows you to add a couple extra metadata fields to entries for ratings and to mark them as read. I’ve used these fields for years and find them super useful for keeping track of how much I like articles and for remembering which ones I’ve actually finished.\nInternally, BibDesk stores this data as entries in the raw BibTex:\n@article{the_citekey_for_this_entry,\n    author = {Whoever},\n    title = {Whatever},\n    ...\n    rating = {4},\n    read = {1}}\nI decided to treat these as Zotero tags, which BibDesk calls keywords. I considered making some sort of programmatic solution and writing a script to convert all the rating and read fields to keywords, but that seemed like too much work—many entries have existing keywords and parsing the file and concatenating ratings and read status to the list of keywords would be hard.\nSo instead I sorted all my entries in BibDesk by rating, selected all the 5 star ones and added a zzzzz tag, selected all the 4 star ones and added a zzzz tag, and so on (so that 1 star entries got a z) tag. I then sorted the entries by read status and assigned xxx to all the ones I’ve read. These tag names were just temporary—in Zotero I changed these to emojis (⭐️⭐️⭐️ and ✅), but because I was worried about transferring complex Unicode characters like emojis across programs, I decided to simplify things by temporarily just using ASCII characters.\n\n\nFiles\nI wanted all the PDFs that Zotero would manage to have nice predictable filenames. In BibDesk, I used this pattern. That’s been fine, but it uses spaces in the file name and doesn’t remove any punctuation or special characters, so it was a little trickier to work with in the terminal or with scripts or for easy consistent searching (especially when searching in the iPad Dropbox app when looking for a PDF to read). But because I set up that pattern in 2008, path dependency kind of locked me in and I’ve been unwilling to change it since.\nSince I’m starting with a whole new reference manager, I figured it was time to adopt a better PDF naming system. In the ZotFile preferences, I set this pattern:\n{%a-}{%y-}{%t}\n…which translates to\nup_to_three_last_names-year-first_few_characters_of_title.pdf\n\n\nCitekeys\nIn BibDesk, I’ve had a citation key pattern that I’ve used for years: Lastname:Year, with up to three last names for coauthored things, and an incremental lowercase letter in the case of duplicates:\nHeissKelley:2017\nHeissKelley:2017a\nImbens:2021\nLundbergJohnsonStewart:2021\nZotero and Better BibTeX preserve citekeys when you import a .bib file, but I wanted to make sure I keep using this system for new items I add going forward, so I changed the Better BibTeX preferences to use the same pattern:\nauth(0,1) + auth(0,2) + auth(0,3) + \":\" + year"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I am happy to share that my MPH thesis at the University of Melbourne, Cost-effectiveness of universal iron supplementation and iron-containing micronutrient powders (MNPs) for anemia among young children in rural Bangladesh, is now published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (AJCN).\nUniversal provision of iron supplements or MNPs to young children in low and middle-income countries with prevalent anemia is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in their guidelines here and here. Recently, the Benefits and Risks of Iron InterventionS in Children (BRISC) trial compared iron supplements and MNPs with placebo in children under 2 years in rural Bangladesh, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of both iron interventions compared with placebo, alongside the trial.\nPart of the rationale for recommending universal iron interventions has been presumed benefit on cognitive development. Previous cost-effectiveness studies of MNPs have used averted productivity losses from improved cognition imputed from observational studies or non-empiric estimates as a health outcome. The BRISC trial was the first with long enough follow-up to have the potential to show a substantial difference in cognition – and did not detect an effect from iron interventions on this outcome, despite finding a significant impact on anemia.\nThe findings of my study demonstrated that far from being cost-effective as previously suggested, iron interventions are in fact an expensive intervention. We demonstrated that the most widely recommended public health intervention, multiple micronutrient powders, are essentially never cost effective. Figure 1 shows that both intervention had 0% probability of cost-effectiveness if we use the likely thresholds (willingness to pay) of $200 and $985 for Bangladesh. If we increase this willingness to pay, iron may have value for money but MNPs are essentially not cost-effective.\nUnder certain conditions and assumptions, iron supplementation may be an intervention that could be considered by policy makers. Our study is the first analysis to demonstrate the value of using high quality empiric data to inform health outcomes in economic analyses of iron interventions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showing the probability that iron supplementation or fortification with MNPs is optimal, compared with no intervention\n\n\nOur findings have important implications for policy and funding decisions for nutrition programs across low- and middle-income countries. Iron interventions in children as recommended by WHO are widely implemented around the world. In 2019, 58 countries implemented home fortifications programs with support from UNICEF, with over 16 million children receiving MNPs. Considering the high number of children with anemia (two out of every five), the costs of implementing iron interventions at large scale can have a huge budget impact and may displace funds that could be spent more effectively on other interventions."
