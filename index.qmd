I am a Research Fellow in the [Health Economics Unit](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/centre-for-health-policy/research-group/health-economics) at the Centre for Health Policy, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health. I also serve as strategy advisor with [Helpman Development Institute](https://www.helpmaninstitute.org/), Abuja, Nigeria. In 2021, I completed a Master's in Public Health University of Melbourne, Australia, with specialization in Health Economics. This September, I will be joining University of Sheffield Four-year Wellcome PhD studentships in [Public Health Economics and Decision Science](https://pheds-dtc.ac.uk/).

My previous work focused on health expenditure studies, healthcare utilization surveys, and other analysis to inform public financing of health in Nigeria. I have recently provided support for health economic analyses and training in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Bangladesh. My current interests include applying methods in cost-effectiveness analysis using individual-level data, healthcare decision modelling, and economic evaluation using infectious disease models to inform decision making on health interventions in developing countries.

I teach introductory classes on use of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
