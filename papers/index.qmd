Most of my research has involved costing or cost-effectiveness analyses to inform interventions for infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. Some of these include mass drug administration for scabies, public health measures for COVID-19, molecular testing for malaria and arboviruses, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. I am mailny interested in improving methods in economic evaluation. I am also keen on assessing multicomponent interventions, conducting evaluations using real-world data, and creating user- friendly decision models.
